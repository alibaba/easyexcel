# EasyExcel, a java toolkit for parsing Excel easily
There are several java frameworks or toolkit which can parse and generate Excel, such as Apache POI or jxl. But they all have some difficulties to handle problems like excessive memory usage. Apache POI framework has a set of SAX mode API can fix some memory overflow problems at some extent, but it still has some flaws. For example, the unzipping and the storage of the unzipping of Excel file in version 07 are done in memory, so the memory consumption is still very high. The EasyExcel toolkit rewrites the logic of POI for parsing Excel version 07. One 3 megabytes Excel file parsed with POI still requires about 100M memory, which can be reduced to a few megabyte by using EasyExcel instead. And yes, there is no memory overflow for even larger excel with EasyExcel. EasyExcel version 03 depends on POI SAX model and does model transformation/encapsulation in the upper layer to make it simpler and more convenient for users.

## Using EasyExcel version 3.0.2+, a machine with 64M RAM can read a 75 megabyte Excel file containing 460,000 rows and 25 columns in 20 seconds
Of course, there is also a very fast mode can be faster, but the memory consumption will be a little more than 100M

## Version support
* EasyExcel version 2+ works on Java7 or Java6
* EasyExcel version 3+ works on Java8 or java8+
### About version upgrade
* It is not recommended upgrading across major versions, especially across 2 major versions.
* There are some incompatibilities in upgrading from version 2+ to version 3+.
  * Using a custom interceptor to modify the style can cause problems, even if it does not compile with errors.
  * When reading the Excel file, the `invoke` function will throw an exception, there will not be an additional layer of `ExcelAnalysisException` wrapped here, and it will not compile with errors.
  * Style and other annotations involving `boolean` or some enumeration values have been changed, adding the default value. The compiler will report an error, just change the annotation.
* It is recommended to re-test the relevant functions after upgrading across major versions.
